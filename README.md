# Cypress Automation Challenge

This is a cypress framework designed to be used as part of the hiring process for QA Automation Engineers. Documentation for the framework can be found [here](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/overview/why-cypress).

## Guidance

The objective of this challenge is to give you a chance to experience the sorts of automation testing problems we are looking to solve at MillTechFX. It also gives us a chance to understand how you think, and how you apply yourself to a task. You will have until the day before your interview to complete this challenge, but please do not spend more than a few hours on it. We are interested in the process you go through as much as the answer you get to so please be prepared to share your thinking with us during the follow up interview.

If, as you complete the challenge, you have any questions, please reachout to your MillTechFX hiring manager.
